## Introduction

### Github

Using GitHub is an effective way to track different versions of a file and allow people to work together on a project. The cycle of pulling a file, editing it, committing it and then pushing it back to GitHub is a great technique to minimize merge conflicts, although it may not always be successful. Repitition seems like the best way to learn all of this.

### Servers

Servers and AWS/EC2

- 127.0.0.1 - Points to own machine (Localhost)
- HTTPS (Secure transfer of data)
- HTTPS: 443 (Special Port for https)
  - Port -> Door into castle
    - Many doors to get into the castle, port can be designated for specific information or traffic
- Special ports for SSH () and HTTP ()
  - HTTP port is not as secure
- Server is castle surrounding services
- Can use a gateway to direct person to other ports in the castle
- We will have gateway (Caddy) that directs to either simon or startup services
- Root domain will be leased for the semester
  - Subdomain for each service
- SSH into server
  - ssh -i key ubuntu@44.193.162.38
- IP Address: 44.193.162.38

DNS and AWS/Route53

- Domain name costs money
- You have to choose and pay for domain name, then associate it with the server
- NS and SOA DNS records come automatically when you get a domain name
- Using \* in the record name allows it to apply to all subdomains
- Certain domains are more expensive than others.
- A request for a domain name requires time to process.
- [subdomain.]\*secondary.top
- Root domain -> secondary.top
- Record types
  - A/AAAA
  - CNAME -> Alias
  - SOA and NS -> Automatically created

Caddy, HTTPS, TLS, certs

- Caddy handles web certificates (importance for HTTPS), serves up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and acts as a gateway for subdomain requests to Simon and startup services
- Caddy incorporates Let's Encrypt ACME Protocol
  - Creates certificates for free that enable widespread use of HTTPS
- Changing the CaddyFile using VI to use the domain name allows your site to use HTTPS and be more secure
- Most browsers now expect HTTPS - Caddy allows this
- You can use the domain name in place of the IP address to ssh into the server
  - ssh -i ~/keys/production.pem ubuntu@rabbitholes.click
- VI
  - Use i to insert, ctrl + c to escape insert
  - x to delete whatever is to the left, X to delete whatever is to the right
  - :wq to save changes and exit file
- HTTPS -> Verifies that the site is legitimate to avoid malicious code being put on device
  - Looks for web cert

## HTML

### Basic HTML file

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang ="eng">
  <head>
    <title>First HTML </title>
  </head>

  <body>
    Hello world
  </body>

</html>
```

Use MDN WebDocs or W3Schools for help with different elements or information

### HTML Structure Assignment

- a href = "link"
  - anchor text to hyperlink

  - inline span of content
- h<1-9>
  - text headers 1-9 (1 is largest, 9 is smallest)
- p
  - paragraph of text

- &lt;
- &gt;
- &quot;
- &apos;
- &#128512;

### HTML Input Assignment

Elements for accepting input of user data
| Element | Meaning | Example |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| form | Input container and submission | <form action="form.html" method="post"> |
| fieldset | Labeled input grouping | <fieldset> ... </fieldset> |

#### Common attributes of input elements

| Attribute | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name      | The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form |
| disabled  | Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input                        |
| value     | The initial value of the input                                                      |
| required  | Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid                             |

You can specify a required attribute so that the attribute must be entered before submitting it.
The pattern attribute on text, search, url, tel, email, and password inputs has a regular expression that must be matched by the input.

If you want to change the default on input type color, it has to be in hexadecimal form (i.e. red is #FF0000)

Range requires some JS

A placeholder displays the provided text in the box as instructions to the user on what information should be input.
