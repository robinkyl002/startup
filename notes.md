## Introduction

### Github

Using GitHub is an effective way to track different versions of a file and allow people to work together on a project. The cycle of pulling a file, editing it, committing it and then pushing it back to GitHub is a great technique to minimize merge conflicts, although it may not always be successful. Repitition seems like the best way to learn all of this.
